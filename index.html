  <h2>
    What is an abortion?
  </h2>

  <body>
    <p>
      An abortion is a safe, effective way for someone to terminate a pregnancy whether it be by choice or out of necessity. The right to an abortion has been challenged by the recent Supreme Court legislature overturning Roe v. Wade.
    </p>

  <h2>
    What is Roe v. Wade?
  </h2>

  <body>
    <p>
      Roe v. Wade is the Supreme Court case that came about in 1973. This case led to American access to safe abortions and bodily autonomy.
    </p>

<br>

  <h2>
    What are the consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned?
  </h2>

  <body>
    <p>
The criminalization of abortions in over half the U.S. states eliminates bodily autonomy for those who may become pregnant. This ban will not eliminate abortions but simply lead to people getting illegal, unsafe abortions. Peopleâ€™s health are being put on line.
